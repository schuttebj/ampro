# Deployment Trigger

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-04 19:30:00

**Purpose:** Force fresh deployment to clear caching issues

## Recent Fixes Applied:

1. ✅ **Updated TransactionType enum** in `app/models/license.py` 
   - Reverted to working values: `APPLICATION_APPROVAL`, `APPLICATION_SUBMISSION`, etc.

2. ✅ **Fixed schema default** in `app/schemas/license.py`
   - Changed from `TransactionType.DRIVING_LICENCE` to `TransactionType.APPLICATION_SUBMISSION`

3. ✅ **Added Migration 025** to revert database enum to working values

4. ✅ **Permissive CORS** settings for debugging

## Expected Resolution:
- Python initialization should succeed
- No more `AttributeError: DRIVING_LICENCE` 
- Database migrations should run properly
- API should start without enum conflicts

**Build Trigger:** Deployment should pick up all recent schema and model fixes.
